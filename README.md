# **Project Deployment with Docker Compose**  

## **Project Overview**  
This project contains two main services:  
- `frontend` (located in `./frontend`)  
- `backend` (located in `./backend`)  

Both services will be built, tagged, and pushed to **Docker Hub**, followed by deployment instructions for **production environments**.

---

## **1️⃣ Build, Tag, and Push Docker Images**  

### **🔹 Step 1: Build Docker Images**  
Run the following command to build the images using Docker Compose:  
```sh
Insert your Build command here
```

### **🔹 Step 2: Tag Docker Images**  
```sh
Insert your Tag command for both services here
```

### **🔹 Step 3: Push Images to Docker Hub**  
```sh
Insert your Push command for both services here
```

## **3️⃣ Deploying in Production**  

### **🔹 On-Premise Deployment**  
To deploy the application on an **on-premise** server with Docker:  
1. Install **Docker** and **Docker Compose** on the server.  
2. Pull the images:  
   ```sh
   Insert the Pull Command for both services here.
   ```
3. Update the `docker-compose.yml` file if needed.  
4. Run the application in detached mode:  
   ```sh
   Insert the required command here.
   ```

### **🔹 AWS Deployment Options**  
For **AWS deployment**, consider the following services:  

1. **AWS EC2** (Elastic Compute Cloud)  
   - Explain what is EC2 and How it helps us for deployment. 

2. **AWS ECS** (Elastic Container Service)
   - Explain what is ECS and How it helps us for deployment.

3. **AWS EKS** (Elastic Kubernetes Service)  
   - Explain what is EKS and How it helps us for deployment.

4. **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**  
   - Explain what is Elastic Beanstalk and How it helps us for deployment.

5. **AWS Lightsail**  
   - Explain what is Lightsail and How it helps us for deployment. 
   
6. **AWS Lambda**  
   - Explain what is Lambda and How it helps us for deployment. 

7. **AWS App Runner**  
   - Explain what is App Runner and How it helps us for deployment.

### **💡 Suggested AWS Services Needed:**  
✅ **Amazon ECR** – To store Docker images.  
✅ **Amazon ECS/EKS** – To run the containers.  
✅ **AWS ALB (Application Load Balancer)** – To handle incoming traffic.  
✅ **Amazon RDS** (Optional) – If using a managed database instead of MongoDB in a container.  
✅ **AWS CloudWatch** – For monitoring logs.  

#### Steps for AWS Deployment:
1. Push your Docker images to **Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)**:
   ```sh
   aws ecr create-repository --repository-name <service-name>
   aws ecr get-login-password --region <your-region> | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <aws-account-id>.dkr.ecr.<your-region>.amazonaws.com
   docker tag <local-image> <aws-account-id>.dkr.ecr.<your-region>.amazonaws.com/<service-name>:<tag>
   docker push <aws-account-id>.dkr.ecr.<your-region>.amazonaws.com/<service-name>:<tag>
   ```
2. Configure and deploy on **ECS/EKS/Elastic Beanstalk**.
3. Set up a **load balancer** and **auto-scaling** if needed.
4. Ensure **IAM roles** and **network configurations** are correctly set.

For a fully automated deployment, consider using **AWS CodePipeline** and **AWS CodeDeploy**.
